# The King County Housing Price Prediction ModelÂ¶

In this project I did EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to get insight from the data and created a model to predict the house pricing in King County. 

### Methodology:

In this project I will follow the OSEMN process to solve a problem and create a model to predict the house pricing in King County. OSEMN is an acronym that represents Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret steps.
